# Introduction to robot vision

The purpose of robot vision is to locate the robot with respect to its
external environment so that it can safely and efficiently perform its
intended tasks. In mobile robotics, the external environment consists
of the robot's destination, routes, obstacles, etc. Knowing its
position and orientation with respect to these elements enables the
robot to safely navigate towards its destination.

In industrial settings, the external environment mainly consists of
obstacles and workpieces: parts to be assembled, panels to be drilled
on, products to be inspected, etc. The objective of this Chapter is to
present the algorithms and software tools to determine precisely the
location of workpieces with respect to the robot, which will next
enable the robot to perform its intended task â€“ assembly, drilling,
inspection, etc.

There are two main types of visual data: 2D (images) and 3D (point
clouds). Section [2D vision](vision_2d.md) presents basic algorithms, such as
filtering or feature detection, and associated software tools to deal
with 2D images. Section [3D vision](vision_3d.md) introduces algorithms for object location
using a 3D camera.
