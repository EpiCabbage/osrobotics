# Processing 3D point clouds using PCL

Contrary to conventional 2D cameras, which provide 2D images of the
world, 3D cameras provide 3D information in the form of point
clouds. A point cloud is a collection of points described by their
X-Y-Z coordinates.

PCL is a good library that provides a number of functionalities to
manipulate point clouds. Unfortunately, contrary to OpenCV, the Python
bindings to PCL are very limited. This tutorial will therefore deal
with the C++ library. 

Since there is already an [excellent PCL tutorial](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/), we shall not
duplicate the effort here. The reader is advised to go through the
whole tutorial, with particular attention to the following
sections:

1. [Basic usage](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/#basic-usage)

2. [I/O](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/#i-o)

3. [Filtering](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/#filtering-tutorial)

4. [Features](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/#features-tutorial)

5. [Recoginition](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/#recognition-tutorial)

6. [Registration](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/#registration-tutorial)


We shall see now, through an example, how PCL can be
used in a robotics setting.

> #### Example::Object pose estimation in PCL
> Many robotic applications require finding the pose (rotation
> and translation) of an object in the scene. A nice tutorial can be

Itâ€™s important to note that with different models and scene some parameter values might need to be adjusted. You **should** play around with them to see how they influence the final result.
