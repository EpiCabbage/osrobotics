## Presentation

The objective of this course is to equip the reader with the _scientific and technical _knowledge to develop advanced applications in industrial robotics. The main features of this course are:

1. Because robotics implies by essence the development of robotic _systems_, every theoretical notions we introduce will be accompanied by practical software examples and exercises. Our objective is that, by the end of this course, the reader will be able to use and/or develop advanced real-world robotics applications by herself. Examples of such applications, developed in our research groups, can be seen in the video below.
